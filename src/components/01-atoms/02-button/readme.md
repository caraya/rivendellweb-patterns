# Buttons

Starting to work on button sets to go along other styles for my projects.

There are a lot of issues left to work through on these button sets.

* They have to match the color palette I finally choose for the site
* They have to be accessible for people with color blindness and other color-related disabilities

## Copy for buttons

When writing copy for buttons, make sure that you keep consistency. Here are a few guidelines I like to set in place at the beginning of a project:

* Chose amount of words: One, or two, or more words per button
* Choose case: Sentence case, or upper case, or title case, or lower case
* Label structure: e.g. ‘verb’ + ‘noun’, or ‘verb’, or ‘verb’ + a + ‘noun’, etc.

I recently read [5 Rules for Choosing the Right Words on Button Labels](https://medium.com/@uxmovement/5-rules-for-choosing-the-right-words-on-button-labels-dc3f74c2c2a3) by [UX Movement](https://medium.com/@uxmovement/) (Paywall). Check it out to learn more about button labelling.
