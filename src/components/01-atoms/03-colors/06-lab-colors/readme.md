# Color experiment in LAB color space

Used Evil Martian's [LCH Color Picker & Converter](https://lch.oklch.com/#)

Note that while this is marked as done you should be careful using it since LAB colors may not have wide support.

Currently Fractal is not importing the LAB colors like it does LCH and sRGB. Still exploring why.
