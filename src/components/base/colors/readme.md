# Colors

I'm still looking for one or two color palletes that I like. In the meantime I'll just use this component to park ideas, in addition to what I already use for the blog and other projects.

## The New Defaults

A replacement for the standard CSS named color system. Provides more visually appealing hues for many CSS keywords; adds new colors with more relevant and easily remembered names. Inspired by [Ingrid Sundbergâ€™s color thesaurus](http://ingridsnotes.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/the-color-thesaurus/) and the work of [Adam Morse](http://clrs.cc/). The original From [Dudley Storey](https://twitter.com/dudleystorey), is available from [Github](http://dudleystorey.github.io/thenewdefaults/)
